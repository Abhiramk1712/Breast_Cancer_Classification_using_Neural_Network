# Breast_Cancer_Classification_using_Neural_Network

- During their life, among 8% of women are diagnosed with Breast cancer (BC), after lung cancer, BC is the second popular cause of death in both developed and undeveloped worlds.
- Classification of breast cancer leads pathologists to find a systematic and objective prognostic, generally the most frequent classification is binary (benign cancer/malign cancer).
- Today, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being broadly used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities.

We will be classifying our neural network in two categories:- 

1. Benign tumor
 - Non-cancerous
 - Capsulated
 - Slow growing
 - Do not spread to other parts of the body
 - Cells are normal

2. Malignant tumor
 - Cancerous
 - Non-capsulated
 - Fast growing
 - Spreads to other parts of the body
 - Cells have large, dark nuclei, may have abnormal growth

- a & b are Benign
- c & d are Malignant

About dataset:-
 - Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure.
 - In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal appearing tissue or body fluid. As with other types of biopsies, the sample collected during this procedure can help make a diagnosis or rule out conditions such as cancer.


Workflow:- 
- Importing the dependencies
- Data Collection and Pre-Processing
- Data Processing
- Training and Testing Datasets
- Building the Neural Network
- Building the Predictive System
